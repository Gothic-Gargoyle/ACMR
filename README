# ACMR
I started this project to be able to control my cupboard model railway layout without
spending tons of cash on vendor-specific transformers and point motors.

## Features:


## To do list:
* Finish motor driver
* Add support for signals (togglebutton maybe?)
* Tie everything together as a functioning unit
* MAYBE switch to a arduino mega since im running out of in/outputs faster than i like.
